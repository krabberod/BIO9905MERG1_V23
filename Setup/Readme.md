# Installation of R and R packages

We will use R (version 4.0.5 or later) and Rstudio (version 1.4.1 or later) in this course. 

Everybody should download and install R (https://www.r-project.org/), Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/) and the required packages before the course starts.

It is preferable that you have all packages installed before the course starts. For those of you having trouble with installing the packages, we will provide some help Monday afternoon, 4pm, but we will not be able to provide comprehensive IT-service though.

These are the required packages for the hands-on exercises of the course: 
```
install.packages("readxl")    # To read excel files
install.packages("tidyverse") # To manipulate and visualize data
install.packages("metacoder")
install.packages("magrittr") 

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("dada2", "phyloseq","Biostrings","PCAtools"))

install.packages("devtools")               # Developer tools
devtools::install_github("tobiasgf/lulu")  # Install LULU from github
```
When installing Lulu you might run into this error: 

```diff
 "Error: Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub:
 Line starting 'E ...' is malformed!"
```

If you get this error one solution might be to change the locale (run these in R):
```
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","en_US.UTF-8")
```
or
```
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","English")
```

More packages, including those that have been mentioned, but not necessarily used in the hands-on sessions can be found in the script [R packages](Install_packages.R).
