### Prologue: R Notebooks
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Networks in R
In this example we will look at networks generared with sparCC (Friedman and Alm, PLoS Com.Biol 2012). The SpiecEasi package contains a nice wrapper for running sparcc on phyloseq objects in R.  

### Load necessary packages
First wee need to Load necessary packages, and install SpiecEasi if necessary.
```{r}

library(igraph)
library(phyloseq)
library(devtools)
install_github("zdk123/SpiecEasi")
library(SpiecEasi)
library(Matrix)
```

We also need to load the phyloseq object created by Dada2. Adjust the path if necessary. 
```{r}
OsloFjord_phyloseq <- readRDS("OsloFjord_phyloseq.rds")

# Function to remove samples, these have NA for all ctd-data. Not executed
#OsloFjord_phyloseq<-subset_samples(OsloFjord_phyloseq, sample_names(OsloFjord_phyloseq) != "S07")
#OsloFjord_phyloseq<-subset_samples(OsloFjord_phyloseq, sample_names(OsloFjord_phyloseq) != "S09")

#Make year into factor
sample_data(OsloFjord_phyloseq)$Year <- as.character(sample_data(OsloFjord_phyloseq)$Year)

OsloFjord_phyloseq

```

### Run sparCC
Phyloseq comes with a wrapper that makes running sparcc easy.   
First we look at how the samples relates to each other, based on the correlation between read abundance of the otus. 

```{r}
system.time({ 
sparcc.samples <- sparcc(otu_table(OsloFjord_phyloseq), iter=200,inner_iter=100)
str(sparcc.samples)
})
```

The sparcc object contains two list, the co-variance score and the correlation. In addition you should get boostrap and empirical p-values for the network. This takes some time, since the data is permutated and networks correlation scores are calculated may times over. 

```{#r}
sparcc.samples.boot <- sparccboot(otu_table(OsloFjord_phyloseq), R =100, ncpu=4)
sparcc.samples.pval <- pval.sparccboot(OsloFjord.sparcc.samples.boot)
```

  
### Making a network of the correlation matrix
Turning the correlation values into a network requires a few steps. 
```{r}

row.names(sparcc.samples$Cor)<-row.names(sample_data(OsloFjord_phyloseq))
colnames(sparcc.samples$Cor)<-row.names(sample_data(OsloFjord_phyloseq))
hist(sparcc.samples$Cor)


## Define threshold for SparCC correlation matrix for the graph
sparcc.graph.matrix <- abs(sparcc.samples$Cor) >= 0.1
#sparcc.graph.matrix
diag(sparcc.graph.matrix) <- 0
sparcc.graph.matrix <- Matrix(sparcc.graph.matrix, sparse=TRUE)

# Create igraph objects from the adjacency matrix 
sparcc.graph <- adj2igraph(sparcc.graph.matrix, vertex.attr = list(name=row.names(otu_table(t(OsloFjord_phyloseq)))))
sparcc.graph
```

- The graph has 17 vertices (node/otus) and 20 edges   
- Attribute for the vertices (v/c) is `name` (i.e. the otu name)
- Attribute for the edges (e/n) is `weight` (i.e. the otu name)
- It is possible to add more attributes to either edges or vertices using `V(phyloseq_object)$new_attribute` and `E(phyloseq_object)$new_attribute`for the edges.

### Graph statistics

``` {r}
# How connected are the nodes?
degree(sparcc.graph)
#degree.distribution(sparcc.graph)

# extract the correaltion score for the graph
elist.sparcc<- summary(sparcc.graph.matrix*sparcc.samples$Cor)
elist.sparcc

cat("\nNetwork stats\n", "Clustering coefficient: ", ClusteringCcoefficient <- transitivity(sparcc.graph), "\n")
cat("Betweenness entrality: ", BetweennessCentrality<- edge_betweenness(sparcc.graph),"\n")
cat("Average path length: ", AveragePathLength <- average.path.length(sparcc.graph),"\n")

```

### Plotting
Plotting can be done in many different ways. Play with the settings to find somethign interesting

```{r}
plot(sparcc.graph,vertex.size=1)
plot(sparcc.graph,vertex.size=4, layout=layout_in_circle, vertex.label.dist=1.5)

#The plotting funciton in phyloseq takes graph and phyloseq objects as input
plot_network(sparcc.graph, OsloFjord_phyloseq, color="Year")
```

- Using the ctd-data can you create a factor that specifies months, and redo the network but with year as shape and months as colors? (hint use `sample_data(phyloseq_object)$new_variable` to add metadata to to  an existingphyloseq object.




### Adding the correlation score as weights to the graph

```{r}
elist.sparcc<- summary(sparcc.graph.matrix*sparcc.samples$Cor)
E(sparcc.graph)$weight<-elist.sparcc[,3]
E(sparcc.graph)$width <- 25*E(sparcc.graph)$weight
V(sparcc.graph)$color <- "blue"

#set.seed(666)
plot(sparcc.graph,vertex.size=4, vertex.label.dist=2, layout=layout_with_mds)

# see help(layout)
```
- Maybe there are better ways of using the weights? For the graph above I simply multiplied the weight of the edge with a more or less randomly chosen number to make the lines visible.  

# Networks for the OTUs.
The procedure is the same, but this time we need to transpose the otu table. Notice the function `t()` added around the phyloseq object. The sparcc inference will take a longer time for this matrix since there are many more otus than samples. The number of iterations is set low to save time, but should ideally be higher (20+).

```{r}
system.time({ 

sparcc.outs<- sparcc(otu_table(t(OsloFjord_phyloseq)), iter=10,inner_iter=20)
str(sparcc.outs)

})
```

The sparcc object contains two list, the co-variance score and the correlation. In addition you should get boostrap and empirical p-values for the network. This takes some time, since the data is permutated and networks correlation scores are calculated may times over. 

```{#r}
sparcc.outs.boot <- sparccboot(t(otu_table(OsloFjord_phyloseq)), R =100, ncpu=4)
sparcc.outs.pval <- pval.sparccboot(sparcc.outs.boot)
```

  
### Making a network of the correlation matrix
Turning the correlation values into a network requires a few steps. 
```{r}

row.names(sparcc.outs$Cor)<-row.names(otu_table(OsloFjord_phyloseq))
colnames(sparcc.outs$Cor)<-row.names(otu_table(OsloFjord_phyloseq))
hist(sparcc.outs$Cor, main = "Correlation values from sparCC")


## Define threshold for SparCC correlation matrix for the graph
# Can be set much higher for the otus, than samples. 
# Should ideally be seen in conjunction with p-vaues. 
sparcc.otu.graph.matrix <- abs(sparcc.outs$Cor) >= 0.7
#head(sparcc.otu.graph.matrix)
diag(sparcc.otu.graph.matrix) <- 0
sparcc.otu.graph.matrix <- Matrix(sparcc.otu.graph.matrix, sparse=TRUE)

# Create igraph objects from the adjacency matrix 
sparcc.outs.graph <- adj2igraph(sparcc.otu.graph.matrix, vertex.attr = list(name=row.names(otu_table(OsloFjord_phyloseq))))
sparcc.outs.graph

```
- The content of the igraph object, after setting the threshold for Correlation
- It has 593 vertices (node/otus) and 181 edges   
- Attribute for the vertices (v/c) is `name` (i.e. the otu name)
- Attribute for the edges (e/n) is `weight` (i.e. the otu name)
- It is possible to add more attributes to either edges or vertices using `V(phyloseq_object)$new_attribute` and `E(phyloseq_object)$new_attribute`for the edges.


### Some of the statistics for the graph

``` {r}
# How connected are the nodes?
tail(sort(degree(sparcc.outs.graph)))
ave(degree(sparcc.outs.graph))[1]
#ectract the correaltion score for the graph
elist.sparcc<- summary(sparcc.otu.graph.matrix*sparcc.outs$Cor)
hist(elist.sparcc$x, breaks = 20)

```

### Plotting
Plotting otus will give amuc more clutterd graph than the samples, due to the high number elements (edges and nodes)

```{r}
plot(sparcc.outs.graph,vertex.size=1)
plot(sparcc.outs.graph,vertex.size=0, layout=layout_in_circle, vertex.label=NULL)

#The phyloseq network plotting function is easier to use on this network
plot_network(sparcc.outs.graph, OsloFjord_phyloseq, type="taxa", color = "Supergroup")
```

- See if you can write a function that gives different color, or thickness to the edges depending on wheter they are positive or negative.  
Removing nodes (otus) not connected to the rest of the graph makes it tidier

```{r}
simplified.graph <- delete.vertices(sparcc.outs.graph,which(degree(sparcc.outs.graph)<1))

plot_network(simplified.graph, OsloFjord_phyloseq,type= "taxa", color = "Supergroup")

```

### Saving the network
There are several different formats for saving, example with graphml. 

```{r}
write.graph(sparcc.outs.graph, "Oslofjorden.sparcc.outs.graphml", format = "graphml")
```
