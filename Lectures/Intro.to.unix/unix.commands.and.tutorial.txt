# Unix tutorial
  
1. Open the terminal, go to your "home" folder or another chosen location 

2. Create a directory called "biocourse" (use cd)

3. Go into the biocourse directory, and create the file "norwegian.black.metal.bands" (use nano, emacs, vi)
     and write "windir, gorgoroth, emperor, abbath, urgehal"
     
     If you have issues with the text editors, then run
        echo "windir, gorgoroth, emperor, abbath, urgehal" > norwegian.black.metal.bands
     What did we do in the line above?
     
4. Count how many words we have in the file norwegian.black.metal.bands (use wc -w)

5. Concatenate norwegian.black.metal.bands into a new file with repeated contents
     cat norwegian.black.metal.bands norwegian.black.metal.bands >  norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2

6. Open the new file norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2

7. Count again the number of words

8. See the unique words:
	 less norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2 | sort | uniq

9.  Match the pattern "emperor" in the file norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2
     grep --color "emperor" norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2
     What do the results tell you?

10. Paste the contents of norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2 next to each other
     paste norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2 norwegian.black.metal.bands.x2 > norwegian.black.metal.bands.x4
     See the contents and match the pattern "abbath"

11. Concatenate the contents of one file after the other
     cat norwegian.black.metal.bands.x4 norwegian.black.metal.bands.x4 > norwegian.black.metal.bands.x8

12. Replace in the document the band "gorgoroth" by "norwegian.reggaeton"
     sed "s/gorgoroth/norwegian.reggaeton/g" norwegian.black.metal.bands.x8 > norwegian.black.metal.bands.x8.v2

13. Let's change the order of bands with awk
     less norwegian.black.metal.bands.x8.v2 | awk '{print$2,$1,$5,$3,$10,$6,$9,$8}' > norwegian.black.metal.bands.x8.v2.reordered
     With "print" we indicate the order of the fields in the new file
      
14. We add the prefix bandname to each field
     less norwegian.black.metal.bands.x8.v2.reordered | awk '{print "bandname", $0}'
    
15. Have a look to the permissions of the files that were created:
     ls -l norwegian.black.metal.bands*    
     What do these permissions mean?

16. Change the permissions of one of the created files
     chmod 777  norwegian.black.metal.bands
     What permissions did we give to this file? What can group and other users can do with it?

17. Remove the file
     rm norwegian.black.metal.bands
    
18. Go one level up from the directory biocourse. Try to remove it with:
     rmdir biocourse
     What is happening? how would you solve this? NB: no need to actually remove this directory unless you want to do it.
